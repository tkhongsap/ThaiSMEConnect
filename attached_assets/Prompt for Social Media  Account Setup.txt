We are building an authentication system for SME Digital Leap (V1) that allows users to sign up and log in using social media accounts (Google & Facebook). Additionally, we need a test account with predefined credentials (username: test, password: test) for quick access during development.

The system should be deployed on Replit and integrate OAuth authentication securely while providing a simple user interface for login options.

<your_task>
1. **Set up OAuth Authentication**
   - Configure Google and Facebook OAuth credentials.
   - Use Firebase Authentication (recommended) or OAuth2 via Passport.js (Node.js) for handling sign-ins.

2. **Develop Backend API**
   - Create authentication endpoints for:
     - Sign-up/Login with Google
     - Sign-up/Login with Facebook
     - Sign-in using the test account
   - Issue JWT tokens for authenticated users.
   - Implement session management.

3. **Implement Frontend Login Page**
   - Provide UI buttons for:
     - Sign in with Google
     - Sign in with Facebook
     - Sign in using the test account
   - Redirect users after successful authentication.

4. **Test Account Setup**
   - Hardcode a test user in the database or backend logic:
     ```json
     {
       "username": "test",
       "password": "test"
     }
     ```
   - Ensure this test user bypasses OAuth authentication.

5. **Deployment & Security**
   - Deploy the authentication system on Replit.
   - Secure OAuth credentials using Replit's **Secrets Manager**.
   - Ensure proper session handling and error logging.

</your_task>

<rules>
- OAuth credentials must be stored securely in environment variables.
- Authentication flows should be tested in a secure development environment before production.
- The test account should only be available in the development environment.
- Ensure proper error handling and logging for debugging.
- The UI should be simple and user-friendly, guiding users through login options.
